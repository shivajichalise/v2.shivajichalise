# Decentralization vs Trust

_TRUTH >> TRUST_

In today's digital age, the clash between decentralization and trust gives birth to a cornerstone debate.
Blockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies
for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner.

Decentralization aims to give control back to the people,
while our trust traditionally relies on central authorities to validate our interactions and keep society together.

Decentralization stops a single entity to call the shots, making it harder for anyone to manipulate the system
or pull the strings behind the scenes. Instead of trusting a third party to validate transactions,
decentralized architecture puts its faith in math.

This is where the idea of "The Superiority of Cryptographic Truth" arrives.

Instead of the blind **_'trust me bro'_** approach with a central authority, blockchain puts its faith in fancy math.

This cryptographic truth is very solid, giving us a new way to trust without relying on faulty humans.

In cryptographic truth, there isn't some person somewhere that decides what happens. There's **math**. There's **encryption**.
And as long as math and encryption works as expected, we're gonna get what we expect from the system.

"If we are able to provide cryptographic truth to the world in an easily consumable, secure, easy-to-use, and easy-to-implement"
then that is how the whole world will work."
