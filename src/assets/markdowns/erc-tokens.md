# ERC Tokens

There are many Ethereum standards. Below 2 are the most well-known and popular:

- **ERC-20**
- **ERC-721**

Before we dive into these, let's first understand what exactly a token is.

### Token

> A token refers to a digital asset or unit of value that is created and managed on a blockchain platform.
> Tokens can represent various types of assets, rights, or utilities.

In ethereum, tokens can represent virtually anything.
Reputation points in an online platform,
skills of a character in a game,
financial assets like a share in a company
a fiat currency like USD,
an ounce of gold,
and more.

## 1. **ERC-20**:

- The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words,
  they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token.
  For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.
  (e.g. 1 NPR coin will always be equal to any other 1 NPR coin)

- ERC-20 provides below functionalities:

  1. Transfer tokens from one account to another.
  2. Get the current token balance of an account.
  3. Approve whether an amount of token from an account is spendable by a third-party account.
  4. Get the total supply of the token available on the network.

If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-20 Token Contract and,
once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens on Ethereum.

#### Methods:

<code language="sol">
function name() public view returns (string)
function symbol() public view returns (string)
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
</code>

#### Events:

<code language="sol">
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
</code>

Let's understand the purpose of each of the methods.

1. name()

- It returns the name of the token.

2. symbol()

- It returns the symbol of the token.

3. decimals()

- It returns the number of decimals the token uses.
- e.g. If **8** is returned then the token amount is to be divided by **100000000** to get the user representation.

4. totalSupply()

- It returns the total supply of the tokens.

5. balanceOf(address \_owner)

- It returns of account balance of an account with address \_owner

6. transfer(address \_to, uint256 \_value)

- It transfers \_value to an account with address \_to
- It **MUST** emit **Transfer** event.
- The function **SHOULD** throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

7. transferFrom(address \_from, address \_to, uint256 \_value)

- It transfers \_value from account with address \_from to the address \_to.
- It **MUST** emit **Transfer** event.
- This method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
- The function **SHOULD** throw unless the \_from account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

8. approve(address \_spender, uint256 \_value)

- Allows \_spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the \_value amount.
- If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with \_value.

9. allowance(address \_owner, address \_spender)

- It returns the amount which \_spender is still allowed to withdraw from \_owner.

Let's understand the purpose of each of the events.

1. Transfer

- This event **MUST** trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.
- A token contract which creates new tokens **SHOULD** trigger a Transfer event with the
  \_from address set to 0x0 when tokens are created.

2. Approval

- This event **MUST** trigger on any successful call to approve(address \_spender, uint256 \_value).

There are already many implementations of ERC-20 compliant tokens in Ethereum network.
Different implementation by different teams comes with different trade-offs; including gas saving to improved security.

Please refer to [this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) for more detailed explanation.

## 2. **ERC-721**:

- ERC-721 ntroduces a standard for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), in other words,
  this type of Token is unique and can have different value than another Token from the same Smart Contract.

- ERC-721 provides functionalities similar to ERC-20 tokens.

1. Transfer tokens from one account to another.
2. Get the current token balance of an account.
3. Get the owner of a specific token.
4. Get total supply of the token available on the network.
5. Approve that an amount of token from an account can be moved by a third party account.

The uniqueness of each ERC721 token is a key characteristic.
There are one and only one of these ERC721 Tokens when you create an ERC721 token.
These tokens, as NFTs, are spreading the idea and use of new assets to Ethereum.

If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-721 Token Contract.

#### Methods:

<code language="sol">
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
</code>

#### Events:

<code language="sol">
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
</code>

Let's understand the purpose of each of the methods.

1. blanceOf(address \_owner)

- Count all NFTs assigned to an owner and return the number of NFTs owned by \_owner.

2. ownerOf(uint256 \_tokenId)

- Returns the address of the owner of the NFT.
- NFTs assigned to the zero address are considered invalid, and this function throws for queries about the zero address.

3. safeTransferFrom(address \_from, address \_to, uint256 \_tokenId, bytes data)

- It transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address.

4. safeTransferFrom(address \_from, address \_to, uint256 \_tokenId)

- It transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address.
- This works identically to the other function with an extra data parameter, except this function just sets data to "".

5. transferFrom(address \_from, address \_to, uint256 \_tokenId)

- It transfers ownership of an NFT to another address.
- Remember, when invoking this method **THE CALLER IS RESPONSIBLE TO CONFIRM THAT \_to IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING NFTS
  OR ELSE THEY MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST**

6. approve(address \_approved, uint256 \_tokenId)

- It is used to change or reaffirm the approved address for an NFT.
- The zero address indicates there is no approved address.

7. setApprovalForAll(address \_operator, bool \_approved)

- It is invoked to enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of msg.sender's assets.
- It emits the ApprovalForAll event.
- The contract MUST allow multiple operators per owner.

8. getApproved(uint256 \_tokenId)

- It is invoked to get the approved address for a single NFT with id \_tokenId.

9. isApprovedForAll(address \_owner, address \_operator)

- This method is invoked to query if an address is an authorized operator for another address.
