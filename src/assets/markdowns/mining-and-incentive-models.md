# Mining and incentive models

### Mining

> Mining is the process of validating and adding transactions details like sender address, hash value, etc to a blockchain ledger.
> In cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, known as proof-of-work (PoW) puzzles.
> These puzzles require significant computational power and energy consumption to solve.

In the process of bitcoin mining, the verification of data within a block of the blockchain is
achieved by producing a cryptographic solution that meets certain predetermined conditions.
Upon successfully finding the correct solution, miners are rewarded with bitcoin as well as fees for their computational efforts.

As time progresses, the reward for mining bitcoin is gradually reduced.
This reduction in reward persists until the total circulating supply of bitcoin reaches 21 million.
At this point, the reward mechanism for bitcoin mining is anticipated to transition solely to
fees paid by users for transaction processing services.

### Incentive models

Incentive models in blockchain networks are designed to encourage participation
and ensure the security and sustainability of the network.
There are various ways in which participants in a blockchain network can be incentivized:

1. **Block Rewards**:
   Miners are rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency coins, known as block rewards,
   for successfully adding a new block to the blockchain.
   These rewards serve as an incentive for miners to dedicate computational resources
   to validate transactions and maintain the network.

2. **Transaction Fees**:
   In addition to block rewards, miners also collect transaction fees associated with the transactions
   they include in the blocks they mine.
   A small amount is charged to the user who send transactions to the Blockchain network.
   These fees help in the mining process and reward the miners for providing their computing power for the operations.

3. **Staking Rewards**:
   In Proof of Stake (PoS) and other consensus mechanisms, participants (validators) are rewarded for staking or
   locking up their cryptocurrency holdings to secure the network.
   Validators receive rewards for validating transactions and creating new blocks.
